## Objective

In this assignment, I will build an Emojifier using word vector representations. The goal is to enhance text messages by automatically adding appropriate emojis to make them more expressive and engaging. Instead of writing plain sentences, the emojifier app will intelligently add emojis to convey emotions and sentiments effectively.

By implementing this model, I will be able to input a sentence and find the most suitable emoji to accompany it, making the message more captivating and impactful. The emojifier will transform mundane text messages into lively and emotive conversations, adding a touch of creativity and personalization to each message.

With the power of word vector representations, I will create an emojifier that revolutionizes the way we communicate through text messages, making them more dynamic, fun, and expressive.
